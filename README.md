# AI for Colonoscopy

## Why colonoscopy means a lot? 

Colorectal cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, can often be prevented through early detection and removal of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies. However, the accuracy of these procedures heavily relies on the endoscopist's expertise and attention, which can be subject to human limitations such as fatigue and varying levels of experience.

## Why AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of gastroenterology, particularly in colonoscopy procedures. Our research project explores the critical role of AI in enhancing the accuracy, efficiency, and overall effectiveness of colonoscopies. 

## Welcome to the world of intelligent colonscopy

We have witnessed a huge progress of intelligent colonoscopy techniques in past five years

- In MICCAI'2020 conference, we build a gloden baseline model PraNet ([Springer page](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59725-2_26)) for image-level polyp segmentation, which is pretty popular in the research community and received more than 1100+ citations ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kakwJ5QAAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=kakwJ5QAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C)) and 400+ stars ([GitHub](https://github.com/DengPingFan/PraNet)).
