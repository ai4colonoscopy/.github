Let's face it - colorectal cancer is a big deal. It's one of the top cancer killers worldwide. But here's the good news: we can often prevent it if we catch it early. That's where colonoscopies come in. They're our best shot at finding and removing those sneaky precancerous polyps before they cause trouble to your body.

But here's the catch - colonoscopies are only as good as the doctor performing them. And let's be real, even the best doctors are human. They get tired, they might miss things sometimes, and some are more experienced than others.

## 🤖 Enter AI: The Game-Changer

This is where AI swoops in like a superhero! We're using cutting-edge artificial intelligence to endower colonoscopy a major upgrade. Think of it as giving doctors a pair of super-AI-powered glasses that help them spot things they might otherwise miss.

That's why we're going to explore the critical role of AI in colonoscopy. Here's what AI brings to the table:

- 🔍 **Improved polyp detection rates**
    - AI is like a tireless assistant, constantly scanning for even the tiniest polyps that human eyes might overlook.
- 🎯 **High sensitivity in distinguishing precancerous polyps**
    - Not all polyps are created equal. AI can be trained to differentiate between the harmless ones and those that could become cancerous, helping doctors prioritize treatment.
- 🖼️ **Enhanced overall precision of colon evaluation**
    - It's not just about spotting polyps. AI provides a comprehensive view of the colon, helping doctors make more accurate assessments.
- 😀 **No added risk to colonoscopy**
    - Here's the best part - all these benefits come with zero additional risk to the patient. It's like getting a free upgrade on your health check!


## 🌏 IntelliScope Adventure: Welcome to the World of Intelligent Colonoscopy!

The past few years have been a wild ride in the world of **intelligent colonoscopy** techniques. Let me tell you about one of our proudest achievements:

- `[2024]` **ColonINST & ColonGPT** (On the way! Stay tuned and keep patience!)
    - This year, we’re taking intelligent colonoscopy to the next level, a multimodal world, with three groundbreaking initiatives:
    - 💥 Collecting a very-large multimodal dataset ColonINST, featuring 300K+ colonoscopy images, 62 categories, 128K+ GPT-4V-generated medical captions, and 450K+ human-machine dialogues.
    - 💥 Developing the first multimodal language model ColonGPT that can handle conversational tasks based on user preferences.
    - 💥 Launching a multimodal benchmark to enable fair and rapid comparisons going forward.
