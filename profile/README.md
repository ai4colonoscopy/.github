# AI4Colonoscopy: Revolutionizing Cancer Prevention

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Ever wondered how we could make colonoscopies more effective? Well, buckle up, because we're about to dive into the exciting world of **AI-powered Colonoscopy**!

## Why Should You Care About Colonoscopies?

Let's face it - colorectal cancer is a big deal. It's one of the top cancer killers worldwide. But here's the good news: we can often prevent it if we catch it early. That's where colonoscopies come in. They're our best shot at finding and removing those sneaky precancerous polyps before they cause trouble.

But here's the catch - colonoscopies are only as good as the doctor performing them. And let's be real, even the best doctors are human. They get tired, they might miss things, and some are more experienced than others.

## Enter AI: The Game-Changer

This is where AI swoops in like a superhero! We're using cutting-edge artificial intelligence to give colonoscopies a major upgrade. Think of it as giving doctors a pair of super-powered glasses that help them spot things they might otherwise miss.

## Welcome to the Future of Colonoscopies!

The past five years have been a wild ride in the world of **intelligent colonoscopy** techniques. Let me tell you about one of our proudest achievements:

- `2020-MICCAI PraNet` for image-level polyp segmentation
    - It's racked up over 1,100 citations on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kakwJ5QAAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=kakwJ5QAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C), and counting!
    - Our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DengPingFan/PraNet) is pretty with more than 400 stars!
- `2021-MICCAI PNSNet` for video-level polyp segmentation
- `2022-MIR SUN-SEG` for video-level polyp segmentation
- This year! We ... 

But hey, this is just the beginning. We're on a mission to make colonoscopies smarter, more accurate, and ultimately save more lives. Want to join us on this exciting journey? Keep reading, and let's revolutionize cancer prevention together! ðŸš€ðŸ”¬
