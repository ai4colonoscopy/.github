# AI4Colonoscopy: Revolutionizing Cancer Prevention

Hey there! 👋 Ever wondered how we could make colonoscopies more effective? Well, buckle up, because we're about to dive into the exciting world of **intelligent colonoscopy**!

## 🏥 Why Should You Care About Colonoscopy?

Let's face it - colorectal cancer is a big deal. It's one of the top cancer killers worldwide. But here's the good news: we can often prevent it if we catch it early. That's where colonoscopies come in. They're our best shot at finding and removing those sneaky precancerous polyps before they cause trouble to your body.

But here's the catch - colonoscopies are only as good as the doctor performing them. And let's be real, even the best doctors are human. They get tired, they might miss things sometimes, and some are more experienced than others.

## 🤖 Enter AI: The Game-Changer

This is where AI swoops in like a superhero! We're using cutting-edge artificial intelligence to endower colonoscopy a major upgrade. Think of it as giving doctors a pair of super-AI-powered glasses that help them spot things they might otherwise miss.

That's why we're going to explore the critical role of AI in colonoscopy. Here's what AI brings to the table:

- 🔍 **Improved polyp detection rates**
    - Our AI is like a tireless assistant, constantly scanning for even the tiniest polyps that human eyes might overlook.
- 🎯 **High sensitivity in distinguishing precancerous polyps**
    - Not all polyps are created equal. Our AI is trained to differentiate between the harmless ones and those that could become cancerous, helping doctors prioritize treatment.
- 🖼️ **Enhanced overall precision of colon evaluation**
    - It's not just about spotting polyps. Our AI provides a comprehensive view of the colon, helping doctors make more accurate assessments.
- 😀 **No added risk to colonoscopy**
    - Here's the best part - all these benefits come with zero additional risk to the patient. It's like getting a free upgrade on your health check!

## 🌏 Welcome to the world of intelligent colonoscopy!

The past few years have been a wild ride in the world of **intelligent colonoscopy** techniques. Let me tell you about one of our proudest achievements:

- `[MICCAI'2020] PraNet` ([Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59725-2_26) & [Code](https://github.com/DengPingFan/PraNet))
    - 💥 A gloden baseline for image-level polyp segmentation
    - It's racked up over 1,100 citations on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=kakwJ5QAAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=kakwJ5QAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C), and counting!
    - Our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DengPingFan/PraNet) is very popular with more than 400 stars!
- `[MICCAI'2021] PNSNet` ([Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87193-2_14) & [Code](https://github.com/GewelsJI/PNS-Net))
    - 💥 This super-efficient model (~140fps) is designed for video-level polyp segmentation.
    - We received MICCAI Student Travel Award ([link](https://www.miccai2021.org/en/MICCAI-2021-TRAVEL-AWARDS.html))
    - It's already racked up over 130 citations ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=oaxKYKUAAAAJ&authuser=1&citation_for_view=oaxKYKUAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC)).
- `[MIR-2022] SUN-SEG` ([Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11633-022-1371-y) & [Code](https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS))
    - 💥 We introduce a large-scale and high-quality per-frame annotated VPS dataset, named SUN-SEG, which includes 158,690 frames from the famous [SUN-database](http://amed8k.sundatabase.org/). We extend the expert labels with diverse types, ie, object mask, boundary, scribble, polygon, and visual attribute.
    - Paving the way for future research in colonoscopy video content analysis, with fine-grained categories, annotations.
- `[2024] ColonINST & ColonGPT` (on the way!!)
    - This year, we’re taking intelligent colonoscopy to the next level, a multimodal world, with three groundbreaking initiatives:
    - 💥 Collecting a very-large multimodal dataset ColonINST, featuring 300K+ colonoscopy images, 62 categories, 128K+ GPT-4V-generated medical captions, and 450K+ human-machine dialogues.
    - 💥 Developing the first multimodal language model ColonGPT that can handle conversational tasks based on user preferences.
    - 💥 Launching a multimodal benchmark to enable fair and rapid comparisons going forward.

## 🔭 Bottom line

But this is just the beginning. We’re on a mission to make colonoscopies smarter, more accurate, and ultimately, save more lives. Want to join us on this exciting journey? Stay tuned, and let’s revolutionize cancer prevention together! 🚀🔬
