## ✨ Enter AI4Colonoscopy -- where cutting-edge AI meets life-saving clinical practice

Hey there 👋 We’re not just making colonoscopies "more effective"; we're redefining what early detection can look like, and pushing the next frontier of intelligent healthcare.

With real-time lesion recognition and decision-support powered by deep learning, AI4Colonoscopy has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce missed lesions, and ultimately save lives.

Buckle up — we’re diving into a future where intelligent colonoscopy becomes the new gold standard for cancer prevention.

Let's face it - colorectal cancer is a big deal. It's one of the top cancer killers worldwide. More details refer to latest research and news by Nature: ["subject - colorectal-cancer"](https://www.nature.com/subjects/colorectal-cancer) and ["subject - colonoscopy"](https://www.nature.com/subjects/colonoscopy). Here's the good news: we can often prevent it if we catch it early. That's where colonoscopies come in, as the best preventive measure. They're our best shot at finding and removing those sneaky precancerous polyps before they cause trouble to your body.

## 🤖 Enter AI: The Game-Changer

We're using cutting-edge artificial intelligence to endower colonoscopy a major upgrade. Think of it as giving doctors a pair of super-AI-powered glasses that help them spot things they might otherwise miss.

That's why we're going to explore the critical role of AI in colonoscopy. Here's what AI brings to the table:

- 🔍 **Improved polyp detection rates**
    - AI is like a tireless assistant, constantly scanning for even the tiniest polyps that human eyes might overlook.
- 🎯 **High sensitivity in distinguishing precancerous polyps**
    - Not all polyps are created equal. AI can be trained to differentiate between the harmless ones and those that could become cancerous, helping doctors prioritize treatment.
- 🖼️ **Enhanced overall precision of colon evaluation**
    - It's not just about spotting polyps. AI provides a comprehensive view of the colon, helping doctors make more accurate assessments.
- 😀 **No added risk to colonoscopy**
    - Here's the best part - all these benefits come with zero additional risk to the patient. It's like getting a free upgrade on your health check!


## 🌏 Welcome to the World of Intelligent Colonoscopy!

Next are some of the research breakthroughs from our team that shaped the field of intelligent colonoscopy:

### 🔴 Survey on Intelligent Colonoscopy Techniques

We introduce "ColonSurvey" project, contributing various useful resources for the community. We investigate 63 colonoscopy datasets and 137 deep learning models focused on colonoscopic scene perception, all sourced from leading conferences or journals since 2015. The below figure is a quick overview of our investigation; for a more detailed discussion, please refer to our paper in PDF format.
