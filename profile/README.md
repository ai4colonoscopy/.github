## ✨ Enter AI4Colonoscopy -- where cutting-edge AI meets life-saving clinical practice

Hey there 👋 We’re not just making colonoscopies "more effective"; we're redefining what early detection can look like, and pushing the next frontier of intelligent healthcare.

With real-time lesion recognition and decision-support powered by deep learning, AI4Colonoscopy has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce missed lesions, and ultimately save lives.

Buckle up — we’re diving into a future where intelligent colonoscopy becomes the new gold standard for cancer prevention.

Let's face it - colorectal cancer is a big deal. It's one of the top cancer killers worldwide. More details refer to latest research and news by Nature: ["subject - colorectal-cancer"](https://www.nature.com/subjects/colorectal-cancer) and ["subject - colonoscopy"](https://www.nature.com/subjects/colonoscopy). Here's the good news: we can often prevent it if we catch it early. That's where colonoscopies come in, as the best preventive measure. They're our best shot at finding and removing those sneaky precancerous polyps before they cause trouble to your body.

## 🤖 Enter AI: The Game-Changer

We're using cutting-edge artificial intelligence to endower colonoscopy a major upgrade. Think of it as giving doctors a pair of super-AI-powered glasses that help them spot things they might otherwise miss.

That's why we're going to explore the critical role of AI in colonoscopy. Here's what AI brings to the table:

- 🔍 **Improved polyp detection rates**
    - AI is like a tireless assistant, constantly scanning for even the tiniest polyps that human eyes might overlook.
- 🎯 **High sensitivity in distinguishing precancerous polyps**
    - Not all polyps are created equal. AI can be trained to differentiate between the harmless ones and those that could become cancerous, helping doctors prioritize treatment.
- 🖼️ **Enhanced overall precision of colon evaluation**
    - It's not just about spotting polyps. AI provides a comprehensive view of the colon, helping doctors make more accurate assessments.
- 😀 **No added risk to colonoscopy**
    - Here's the best part - all these benefits come with zero additional risk to the patient. It's like getting a free upgrade on your health check!


## 🌏 Welcome to the World of Intelligent Colonoscopy!

> [!NOTE]
> 📌 **Our Motivation of Reverse Attention -- "Attention Reorienting Mechanism"**
>
> The attention reorienting refers to the phenomenon where human visual attention does not remain fixed, but instead **shifts periodically and rhythmically across different regions of the visual field**.
> 
> This process is especially prominent **when the brain encounters ambiguous, low-contrast, or uncertain information**. Rather than committing to a single viewpoint, the visual system continuously revisits these regions to refine perception, reduce uncertainty, and improve recognition accuracy.
>
> A classic study in visual neuroscience, "[ORIENTING OF ATTENTION. Posner, 1980](https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/hollingworth/prosem/scan_posner_1980.pdf)" indicate several key aspects of this phenomenon:
> - Attention shifts even without eye movements (covert reorientation).
> - These shifts tend to occur periodically -- the brain scans → evaluates → rescans.
> - Ambiguous or important regions receive more frequent revisits.
> 
> In short, this mechanism is crucial for tasks such as detecting lesions, identifying boundaries, or resolving camouflaged objects. **Our Reverse Attention (RA) mimics this periodic reorientation** by refocusing on uncertain areas after processing more obvious regions.

- 🌟 **[Research Highlights]** In this project, we are pushing the boundaries of intelligent colonoscopy by transitioning from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning. Our key contributions are three-fold:
    - We introduce ColonVQA, the **most extensive** (1.1+ million VQA entries), **category-rich** (212,742 images across 76 clinically meaningful findings), and **task-diverse** (18 multimodal tasks organized within a five-level taxonomy) dataset ever built for multimodal colonoscopy analysis. 
    - We characterize two multimodal understanding behaviors – generalizability (**ColonEval**) and reliability (**ColonPert**) – in colonoscopy tasks, and reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy.
    - 💥 We propose a reasoning-focused solution. It includes **ColonReason**, a reasoning dataset annotated by a multi-expert debating pipeline, and **ColonR1**, an R1-styled model enhanced with task-adaptive rewards and gradient-stable optimization, setting a new cutting-edge baseline for colonoscopy analysis.

## 🧩 Collaborating towards the neXt frontier

We are actively looking for potential collaborators to help push this community forward — especially **hospitals or medical institutions that can provide diverse, real-world clinical colonoscopy data (eg., data across different devices, modalities, patient populations, and clinical workflows)**. If you’re interested in contributing or partnering with us, we’d be very happy to connect.

We’re still on the journey toward building truly intelligent colonoscopy systems, and this project is very much under active development. We warmly welcome any feedback, ideas, or suggestions that can help shape its future.
